export const APP_BANNER_TEXT = `This space was created with love — for all the fur babies wandering streets, waiting to be seen, and for the kind humans who care enough to notice them.
  Whether you've found a stray in need, are caring for a rescue, or simply want to help them find a warm, loving home, you've come to the right place.
  Our goal is simple but powerful: connect paws with people. Every post you make could lead to a new beginning for a furry friend.
  Let's build a kind-hearted community — where animals aren't abandoned, they're noticed.
  Where no stray is just a stray, and every life is given the dignity of being loved.`
